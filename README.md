## About me
A passionate Software Engineer in Deloitte Cloud Engineering, specializing in event-driven architecture and backend development. My primary programming language is Java, and I love working with the Spring Framework to build robust and scalable applications. I'm particularly interested in event-driven systems and how they enhance the flexibility and scalability of modern applications. Currently, I'm exploring the power of Apache Kafka to create efficient event-driven solutions. Besides my love for backend technologies, I'm also experienced in leveraging AWS cloud services to design and deploy cloud-native applications. 

Feel free to explore my repositories to find projects related to my interests and endeavors. Don't hesitate to connect with me; I'm always eager to learn and collaborate on exciting new projects. ðŸš€
